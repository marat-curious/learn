# Library `vector` Type

## Programming Implications of Adding Elements to a `vector`

The body of a range `for` must not change the size of the sequence over 
which it is iterating.

## Exercises

3.12. Which, if any, of the following `vector` definitions are in error? For
those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are
not legal, explain why they are illegal ([source](./ex_3_12.cpp)).

3.13. How many elements are there in each of the following `vector`s? What
are the values of the elements ([source](./ex_3_13.cpp))?

3.14. Write a program to read a sequence of `int`s from `cin` and store those
values in a `vector` ([source](./ex_3_14.cpp)).

3.15. Repeat the previous program but read `string`s this time
([source](./ex_3_15.cpp)).

3.16. Write a program to print the size and contents of the `vector`s from
exercise 3.13. Check whether your answer to that exercise were correct.
([source](./ex_3_16.cpp))

3.17. Read a sequence of words from `cin` and store the values a `vector`.
After you`ve read all the words, process the `vector` and change each word
to uppercase. Print the transformed elements, eight words to a line
([source](./ex_3_17.cpp)).

3.18. Is the following program legal? If not, how might you fix it?
([source](./ex_3_18.cpp)).

3.19. List three ways to define a `vector` and give it ten elements, each with
value `42`. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so and why
([source](./ex_3_19.cpp)).

3.20. Read a set of integers into a `vector`. Print the sum of each pair of
adjacent elements. Change your program so that is prints the sum of the first
and last elements, followed by the sum of the second and second-to-last, and
so on ([source](./ex_3_20.cpp)).
