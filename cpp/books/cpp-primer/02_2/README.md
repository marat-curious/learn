# Variables

## Default Initialization

Uninitialized objects of built-in type defined inside a function body have
undefined value.Objects of class type that we do not explicitly initialize
have a value that is defined in class.

## Variable Declarations and Definitions

Variables must be defined exactly once but can be declared many times.
