## 1.4.1. The `while` statement

```
while (condition)
    statement
```

## 1.4.2. The `for` statement

```
for (condition)
    statement
```

[Example](eg_1_4_2.cpp)

## 1.4.3. Reading an unknown number of inputs

[Example](eg_1_4_3.cpp)

### Entering an end-of-file from the keyboard

On Windows systems - CTRL + z
On Unix and MacOSX - Ctrl + d

## 1.4.4. The `if` statement

```
if (condition)
    statement
else

```

[Example](eg_1_4_4.cpp)

## Exercises

1.9: Write a program that uses a while to sum the numbers from 50 to 100.
1.10: Use decrement(--) operator to a `while` that prints the numbers
from 10 down to 0.
1.11: Write a program that prompts the user for two integers. Print each number
in the range specified by those two integers.
1.12: What does the `for` loop do (see source)?
1.13: Rewrite exercise 1.9 with `for` loop
1.14: Compare and contrast the loops that used a `for` with those using a
`while`.
1.15: Write programs that contain the common errors discussed before.
1.16: Write your own version of a program that prints the sum of a set of
integers read from `cin`.
1.17: What happens in the program presented in this section if the input values
are all equal? What if there are no dublicated values?
1.18: Compile and run the program from this section giving it only equal values
as input. Run it agiain giving it values in which no number is repeated.
