# Pointers to Functions

## Exercises

6.54. Write a declaration for a function that takes two `int` parameters and
returns an `int`, and declare a `vector` whose elements have this function
pointer type. ([source](./ex_6_54.cpp))

6.55. Write four functions that add, subtract, multiply, and divide two `int`
values. Store pointers to these values in your `vector` from the previous
exercise. ([source](./ex_6_55.cpp))

6.56. Call each element in the `vector` and print their result.
([source](./ex_6_56.cpp))
