# The Conditinal Operator

## Exercises

4.21. Write a program to use a conditional operator to find the elements in a
`vector<int>` that have odd value and double the value of each such element
([source](./ex_4_21.cpp)).

4.22. Extend the program that assign high pass, pass, and fail grades to also
assign low pass for grades between 60 and 75 inclusive. Write two versions:
One version that uses only conditional operators; the other should use one or
more `if` statements. ([source](./ex_4_22.cpp)).

4.23. The following expression fails to compile due to operator precedence.
Explain why it fails. How you would fix it? ([source](./ex_4_23.cpp))
