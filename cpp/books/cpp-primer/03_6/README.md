# Multidimentional Arrays

## Exercises

3.43. Write three different versions of a program to print the elements of
`ia`. One version should use a range `for` to manage the iteration, the
other two should use an ordinary `for` loop in one case using subscripts
and in the other using pointers. In all three programs write all the types
directly. That is, do not use a type alias, `auto`, or `decltype` to
simplify code ([source](./ex_3_43.cpp)).

3.44. Rewrite the programs from the previous exercises using a type alias
for the type of the loop control variables ([source](./ex_3_44.cpp)).

3.45. Rewrite the programs again, this time using `auto`
([source](./ex_3_45.cpp)).
