# Function Basics

## Exercises

6.1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

6.2. Indicate which of the following functions are in error and why. Suggest
how you might correct the problems. ([source](./ex_6_02.cpp))

6.3. Write and test your own version of fact. ([source](./ex_6_03.cpp))

6.4. Write a function that interacts with the user, asking for a number and
generating the factorial of that number. Call this function from `main`.
([source](./ex_6_03.cpp))

6.5. Write a function to return the absolute value of its argument.
([source](./ex_6_05.cpp))

6.6. Explain the difference between a parameter, a local variable, and a local
`static` variable. Give an example of a function in which each might be useful
([source](./ex_6_06.cpp))

6.7. Write a function that returns `0` when it is first called and then
generates numbers in sequence each time it is called again.
([source](./ex_6_07.cpp))

6.8. Write a header file named `chapter6.h` that cotains declarations for the
functions you wrote for exercises in 6.1. ([source](./ex_6_08.cpp))

6.9. Write your own versions of the `fact.cc` and `factMain.cc` files. These
files should include your `chapter6.h` from the exercises in the previours 
section. Use these files to understand how your compiler supports separate
compilation. ([source](./ex_6_09))
