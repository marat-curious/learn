# Conditinal Statements

## Exercises

5.5. Using an `if-else` statement, write your own version of the program to
generate the letter grade from a numeric grade ([source](./ex_5_05.cpp)).

5.6. Rewrite you grading program to use the conditinal operator in place of
the `if-else` statement ([source](./ex_5_06.cpp)).

5.7. Correct the errors in each of the following code fragments
([source](./ex_5_07.cpp)).

5.8. What is a "dangling else"? How are `else` clauses resolved in C++?

5.9. Write a program using a series of `if` statements to count the number of
vowels in text read from `cin` ([source](./ex_5_09.cpp)).

5.10. There is one problem with our vowel-counting program as we've implemented
it: It doesn't count capital letters as vowels. Write a program that counts
both lower- and uppercase letters as appropriate vowel
([source](./ex_5_10.cpp)).

5.11. Modify our vowel-counting program so that it also counts the number of
blank spaces, tabs, and newlines read ([source](./ex_5_11.cpp)).

5.12. Modify our vowel-counting program so that it counts the number of
occurrences of the following two-character sequence: `ff, fl, fi`
([source](./ex_5_12.cpp)).

5.13. Each of the programs in the highlighted text on page 184 contains a
common programming error. Identify and correct each error
([source](./ex_5_13.cpp)).
