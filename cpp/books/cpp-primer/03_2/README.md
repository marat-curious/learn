# Libraay `string` type

## Exercises

3.2 Write a program to read the standart input a line at a time. Modify your
program to read a word at a time([source](./ex_3_2.cpp)).

3.3 Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the `string` input
operator and in the `getline` function.

3.4 Write a program to read two `string`s and report whether the `string`s are
equal. If not, report which of two is larger. Now, change the program to report
whether the `string`s have the same length, and if not, report which is longer
([source](./ex_3_4.cpp)).

3.5 Write a program to read `string`s from the standart input, concatenating
what is read into one large `string`. Print the concatenated `string`. Next,
change the program to separate adjacent input `string`s by a space
([source](./ex_3_5.cpp)).

3.6 Use a range `for` to change all the characters in a `string` to `X`
([source](./ex_3_6.cpp)).

3.7 What would happen if you define the loop control variable in the previous
exercise as type `char`? Predict the results and the change your program
to use a `char` to see if you were right ([source](./ex_3_7.cpp)).

3.8 Rewrite the program in the first exercise, first using a `while`
and again using a traditional `for` loop ([source](./ex_3_8.cpp)).

3.9 What does the following program do? Is it valid? ([source](./ex_3.9.cpp))

3.10 Write a program that reads a string of characters including punctuation
and writes what was read but with the punctuation removed
([source](./ex_3_10.cpp).

3.11 Is the following range `for` legal? If so, what is the type of `c`?
([source](./ex_3_11.cpp)
