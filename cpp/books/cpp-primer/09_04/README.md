# How a `vector` Grows

## Exercises

9.35. Explain the difference between a `vector`s `capacity` and its `size`.

9.36. Can a container hava a `capacity` less than its `size`?

9.37. Why don't `list` or `array` have a `capacity` member?

9.38. Write a program to explore how `vector`s grow in the library you use.
([source](./ex_9_38.cpp))

9.39. Explain what the following program fragment does.
([source](./ex_9_39.cpp))

9.40. If the program in the previous exercise reads 256 words, what is its
likely `capacity` after it is `resize`d? What if it reads 512? 1000? 1048?
