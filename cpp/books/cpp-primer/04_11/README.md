# Type Conversions

## Named Casts

- `static_cast`
- `dynamic_cast`
- `const_cast`
- `reinterpret_cast`

## Exercises

4.34. Given the variable definitions in this section, explain what convertions
take place in the following expressions ([source](./ex_4_34.cpp)).

4.35. Given the following definitions identify the implicit type conversions,
if any take place ([source](./ex_4_35.cpp)).

4.36. Assuming `i` is an `int` and `d` is a `double` write the expression
`i *= d` so that it does integral, rather than floating-point, multiplication
([source](./ex_4_36.cpp)).

4.37. Rewrite each of the following old-style casts to use a named cast
([source](./ex_4_37.cpp)).

4.38. Explain the following expression ([source](./ex_4_38.cpp)).
