# Simple Statements

## Null Statements

Null statements should be commented. That way anyone reading the code can see
that the statement was omitted intentionally.

## Compound Statements (Blocks)

A block is not terminated by a semicolon.

## Exercises

5.1. What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?
([source](./ex_5_01.cpp))

5.2. What is a block? When might you might use a block?
([source](./ex_5_02.cpp))

5.3. Use the comma operator to rewrite the `while` loop from 1.4.1 so that it
no longer requires a block. Explain whether this rewrite improves or
diminishes the readability of this code ([source](./ex_5_03.cpp)).
