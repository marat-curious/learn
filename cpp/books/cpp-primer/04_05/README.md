# Increment and Decrement Operators

## Exercises

4.17. Explain the difference between prefix and postfix increment
([source](./ex_4_17.cpp)).

4.18. What would happen if the `while` loop in example that prints the
elements from a `vector` used the prefix increment operator
([source](./ex_4_18.cpp))?

4.19. Given that `ptr` points to an `int`, that `vec` is `vector<int>`, and
that `ival` is an `int`, explain the behavior of each of these expressions.
([source](./ex_4_19.cpp)).
