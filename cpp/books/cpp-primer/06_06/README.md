# Function Matching

## Exercises

6.49. What is a candidate function? What is a viable function?

6.50. Given the declarations for `f`, list the viable functions, if any for
each of the following calls. Indicate which function is the best match, or
if the call is illegal whether there is no match or why the call is
ambiguous. ([source](./ex_6_50.cpp))

6.51. Write all four versions of `f`. Each function should print a
distinguishing message. Check your answers for the previous exercise. If your
answers were incorrect, study this section until you understand why your
answers were wrong. ([source](./ex_6_51.cpp))

6.52. Given the following declarations (in source) what is the rank of each
conversion if the follwing calls? ([source](./ex_6_52.cpp))

6.53. Explain the effect of the second declaration in each one of the
following sets of declarations. Indicate which, if any, are illegal.
